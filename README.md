# AI_2

AI_2 is a Python project that implements various clustering algorithms and data structures, including:

- **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree.
- **Clustering with Centroids**: Techniques like K-Means clustering.
- **Clustering with Medoids**: Methods such as K-Medoids clustering.

## Repository Contents

- `avltree.py`: Contains the implementation of the AVL Tree data structure.
- `clustering_with_centroids.py`: Implements clustering algorithms that utilize centroids, such as K-Means.
- `clustering_with_medoids.py`: Implements clustering algorithms that utilize medoids, such as K-Medoids.
- `main.py`: The main script to run the various algorithms.
- `plotter.py`: Provides functionalities to visualize clustering results.
- `util.py`: Contains utility functions used across the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project requires Python 3.6 or higher.

## Usage

1. **Running the Main Script**:

   Execute the `main.py` script to run the implemented algorithms:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will perform clustering on the provided dataset and display the results.

2. **Visualizing Results**:

   The `plotter.py` script can be used to visualize clustering outcomes. Ensure that the necessary plotting libraries (e.g., Matplotlib) are installed.
